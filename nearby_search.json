            "text": "Visited December 16, 2025\n\nFive stars without hesitation. We are heading out tomorrow on a 17 day cruise to Hawaii and flew into San Francisco a day early to settle in and enjoy the city. My original plan for lunch was Chinese food, but I opened my big mouth and told my kids a story from 2020. When we were in LA on our way to Hawaii back then, we stopped at In N Out. My husband and I thought our older daughter, who was not even two at the time, would share the burger with us. Instead she ate the entire thing herself and my husband had to go get another one. 😆\n\nThat story completely sealed our fate. My older daughter refused anything but In N Out, so from the Marriott Marquis where we are staying, we hopped on the cable car and rode all the way there. The place was absolutely packed, but the energy was great and the line moved efficiently. Despite how busy it was, the staff remained friendly, calm, and welcoming, and we were lucky enough to manage getting a table.\n\nA special shout out to Dino who was bussing tables. He was incredibly attentive and kind. He noticed our two little girls right away and surprised them with kids activity books, which completely made their day. He checked on us several times, brought extra napkins, and made sure we were comfortable the entire time. That level of genuine care really stood out.\n\nFor the girls, we ordered two Double Doubles with just cheese, cheese fries, and chocolate milkshakes. For my husband and me, we ordered two Double Doubles with added chilies and grilled onions along with Animal Fries. We made our lemon up ourselves and it was so fresh and so good. Every single bite was delicious and absolutely worth the trip. The food was hot, fresh, and exactly as remembered, maybe even better.\n\nAfter eating, we took the cable car straight back to the hotel and everyone promptly passed out. Waking up at 1 am was no fun, but this experience was completely worth it and gave us such a fun family memory right before our cruise.\n\nThe only small hiccup was entirely on us. We forgot hand sanitizer and the restaurant did not have any available. My six year old had basically touched everything on the cable car 😆 so my husband walked across the street to buy some and paid six dollars for a tiny bottle that would normally cost a dollar elsewhere. Oh well 😆😆\n\nOverall, the food, the service, and the kindness of the staff made this an easy five star experience. Thank you to Dino and the entire team for such a memorable and welcoming visit. We loved every single moment and every bite.",

Would recommend having select times for access.\n\nCheck in process - not great - although the staff member was delightful, we were given poor directions resulting in quite a delay getting into our room when it was late.\n\nThe room was lovely looking HOWEVER noticed the bathroom sink had green mildew in it. (The hole at the front). The hairdryer - likely from when the hotel was first constructed - for such a lovely hotel, would strongly recommend upgrading these for female guests - not to mention it being a fire hazard with so much dust built up on the filter.

This left hotel guests no where to sit. Disappointing for paying guests, unable to use facilities freely due to it “being a popular time of year “.",

It was clear they took pride in taking care of people.\n\nMy room had a great view over the city, and the space felt comfortable and quiet.

Even something small like asking for extra towels felt like it mattered to them.\n\nThe location on Nob Hill is also perfect if you want to explore. You can walk to a lot of places if you do not mind the hills, and it is easy to grab a cable car or rideshare when you want to get across town. I enjoyed the restaurants inside the hotel as well, especially for breakfast.

The Fairmont did an amazing job with the decor and activities that were taking place within the lobby. I nothing negative to say. I am looking forward to my next stay.",

We ordered the Porto. The crust was so thin and had the perfect balance between fluffy and soft. The ndjua was delicious on it but this pizza is more on the umami side of flavors. We wish we got one of the classic pizzas, but definitely coming back to try it out.\nWe also got the Pasta Genovesa, which we lovedddd. The pesto was super rich and every ingredient in the dish was perfectly balanced. Fresh sundried tomatoes, artichokes, pine nuts, goat cheese. Honestly would come back just for that.\n\nWe also got the Tirramisu for dessert! Absolutely must must get!",

But that can just be customized.\n\nThe coal fire was thin and charred well but too many toppings and it just got too floppy. I think the New York style or New Haven style would have been better to order. I did like the pepperonis on it though.\n\nAlso, 2 pizzas is enough for 4 people.

The line moves incredibly fast, and before I knew I was already placing my order. I got the burrito they are known for which is their carne asada super burrito. I got it toasted. You place your order at the front, and then you go inside and pay your bill, and then you wait for them to call your number. The inside of the restaurant is packed, and often you will be sharing your table with other Diners, making it a very communal form of dining. My burrito took about 10 minutes to arrive, and it was probably the best burrito I have ever eaten. It wasn’t as hefty as other burritos, given the lack of rice, which gives it volume, but the meat was so tender, the beans were so well seasoned, and the sour cream, and the guac was so creamy. This was such a satisfying burrito and also the perfect portion size for one person.\n\nI will definitely be back, but I also want to try some other burritos in the neighbourhood.",

I finally made the trip, and honestly, I’m glad I did. The food really is as good as everyone says—an easy 10 out of 10.\n\nThat being said, this place definitely has its cons. You should expect a very long line almost any day of the week. On a lucky day, the wait might be around 20–30 minutes, but it can go much longer. Once you finally reach the front and place your order, you’ll notice the staff is working incredibly fast. They’re not rude at all—they’re just in non-stop hustle mode, so don’t expect a warm chatty environment.\n\nAfter ordering, two new challenges start: finding a seat and waiting for your food. The inside is very small, cramped, and not the most comfortable place to sit. The last time I visited, the food took almost an hour after ordering. It sounds crazy, but the moment the food arrives, everything changes.\n\nThe burritos here truly are on another level. I recommend ordering Mission Style (no rice), which lets the flavors stand out—the guacamole, the steak, the little green beans, everything. They’re generous with the guac, the meat is amazing, and the flavors are insanely well-balanced. You can also ask for Dorado (toasted). I usually say “Mission Style, Dorado,” and it comes out perfectly crispy all around.\n\nEven with the long lines, the tight seating, and the slow wait inside, the food makes up for every single flaw. It really is the best burrito I’ve ever had. I hope one day they expand or speed up the line, but for now, it’s still absolutely worth the hype. This place is magical and a must-try.",

The menu is short, which honestly makes ordering less stressful, and everything feels intentional. You go there knowing you’re getting burgers, fries, and shakes—no distractions. The burgers are fresh, juicy, and taste like they were actually made when you ordered, not pulled from a heat lamp. The toasted buns and crisp lettuce make everything feel balanced instead of greasy.\n\nThe fries are probably the most debated part. On their own, they’re hit or miss since they’re fresh-cut and not super crispy, but ordering them “animal style” changes everything. With cheese, grilled onions, and sauce, they’re way more satisfying. The shakes are thick, classic, and not overly sweet, which makes them easy to finish.\n\nWhat really stands out is the price and consistency. For how good the food is, it’s surprisingly affordable, especially compared to other fast-food chains. The staff is usually friendly and upbeat, and the restaurant stays pretty clean even when it’s packed. Overall, In-N-Out isn’t trying to be fancy—it just does fast food really well, and that’s why people love it.",

The moment I walked in, the smell of freshly baked bread and butter-heavy pastries was irresistible.\n\nI tried their croissant and the famous Morning Bun, and both were absolutely worth the hype. The croissant was perfectly flaky on the outside and soft inside, while the Morning Bun had this beautiful balance of sweetness, cinnamon, and citrus that made it unforgettable. You can truly taste the craftsmanship in every bite.\n\nYes, there was a line—but it moved quickly, and the energy inside was lively and warm. It felt like a place where food is taken seriously, but without any pretension.\n\nMy takeaway:\nTartine Bakery is not just a bakery, it’s an experience. If you’re in San Francisco and love good bread and pastries, this place deserves a spot on your list. I’d happily wait in that line again.",

I lock up my car and walk over and as soon as I cross walk in the door, I smell deliciousness. I check out the display case and I pick a yummy looking scone and order the breakfast sandwich.

The vibe is busy, but relaxed, warm and friendly A few minutes later, my breakfast sandwich is hand delivered and it looks tasty.\n\nThe golden toasted crust of the bread mixed with the soft savory scrambled eggs is the perfect answer to my hunger.

Normally not a fan of scones because they tend to be dry and while I wouldn't call these moist (especially compared to the danish)  they were not dry/crumbly either\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n4.5 stars rounded up to 5.\n\nGreat atmosphere, restaurant was nice, food was good.  We waited in line for about 15 minutes around noon on a Tuesday and were able to find a table fairly easily.  Surprisingly busy for a Tuesday but it was also veterans day.\n\nMy favorite dish was the avocado tartine.  Although it is a simple dish they dressed it up so it was my favorite dish for this visit.  Also had the turkey club that had crispy chicken skin in it. Nice twist and very tasty, salmon tartine, and the carrot/fig salad.  The salmon dish was solid.  Salad was good but I think next time I'd like to try one of their soups.  All the breads were super fresh and tasty too.\n\nFor a sweet treat, we also got the Apple hand pie was also tasty. I would have appreciated this better if they gave us an option to toast or warm this one.",

It’s like a bustling beehive of activity with servers, bussers and the rest of the team dashing around the dining room.\n\nI’ll never understand how Shar, who is the bartender, can take multiple orders, write down your name on the waiting list, eventually seat you, make numerous cocktails and serve plates of meat while at the same time remembering your name. Truly impressive and the kind of old school service I appreciate.\n\nAnd I haven’t even mentioned the food which was excellent. Had to go with the King Henry VIII cut and I finished that along with the bonus portion you get for finishing it. The flavor was spot on but the tenderness and texture is what really sets it apart.

Today, I ordered a simple classic breakfast plate: Eggs (choice of scrambled, poached or fried, i.e sunny side up or over easy), Rosemary Hash Browns and Bacon Strips, with batard toast. I asked for the hash browns \"crispy\" because, well, mushy hash browns defeat the purpose don't they?\n\nThe plate I received had cold toast, coolish hash browns (with a crispy crust, though), and limp, room temperature bacon. The fried eggs were warm but the yolks were hard as rocks. WAY overcooked. The bacon was completely limp - flaccid and room temperature. Not appetizing, and irritating when you are paying $28 with tips and taxes and service fees.\n\nWhat is particularly sad is the bacon was clearly high quality bacon. The hash browns were well seasoned. The Bayard toast would have been fantastic, if it had been served within the zip code of warm.  The owners clearly care about the quality of the food, it is conceived well, and it is made with quality ingredients. The problem is that the kitchen does not seem able to execute on eggs ( not once in many visits for me, but somehow my wife's poached eggs were poached correctly today, something the restaurant has never been able to achieve for me and why I quit ordering the Eggs Benedict because hard egg yolks suck, and egg whites should be included in a poached egg. The kitchen staff cannot understand how to coordinate the components of the plate to be served together hot (or even warm), and the serving staff clearly pays no attention to checking whether the plate is suited to be served. This has ever been my gripe with The Grove - all promise, always complete failure on the final execution.\n\nSo why 3 stars? Always greeted at door with friendly staff passing out me us and welcoming you. Warm and friendly atmosphere. Nice seating areas create a truly nice ambiance. The menu is well thought out, quality ingredients. The juices are top notch. If they could just get staff in the kitchen and serving the food to care and coordinate, and to have consistency.\n\nPersonally, I am tapped out on chances for them to pull it all together, sadly. Cafe De La Presse and dozens of others get the eggs and service right on with 100% accuracy. It is sad The Grove - which should be able to do the same - fails so utterly when they clearly have quality in mind - is simply baffling.",
