A place can have a single primary type from type Table A or type Table B associated with it. For example, the primary type might be mexican_restaurant or steak_house.The primary type may be missing if the place's primary type is not a supported type. When a primary type is present, it is always one of the types in the types field.
A place can have multiple type values from type Table A or type Table B associated with it. For example a restaurant might have the following types: seafood_restaurant, restaurant, food, point_of_interest, establishment.
The address and address components of a place can be tagged with certain types from the Address types and address component types table. For example, an address might be tagged as an street_address and a component of the address might be tagged as a street_number.
You can also specify place types as part of a request. When specified in the request, the type acts as a filter to restrict the response to only include places that match the specified types.

About the type tables
Table A lists the types that are used in the following ways:

As part of a response from Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), and Text Search (New). The request must specify at least one of the places.types or places.primaryType fields in the field mask. The values in Table A are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Nearby Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedTypes, excludedTypes, includedPrimaryTypes, and excludedPrimaryTypes parameter. The values in Table B are then used to populate those fields.
As part of a Text Search (New) request, used as the value of the includedType parameter.
As part of a Autocomplete (New) request, use as the values to the includedPrimaryTypes parameter.
As part of a Autocomplete (New) response.
Table B lists additional place type values which may also be returned as part of a Place Details (New), Nearby Search (New), Text Search (New), and Autocomplete (New) response. The request must specify at least one of the places.types or places.primaryType fields in the field mask. Values from Table B may NOT be used as part of a request, except as the values to the includedPrimaryTypes parameter for a Autocomplete (New) request.

Address types and address component types list types that may appear in either or both address type and address component type arrays in the response body. Address component types are subject to change.

Address types and address component types
The types array in the response indicates the address type. Examples of address types include a street address, a country, or a political entity. The types array in the AddressComponent field indicates the type of each part of the address. Examples include street number or country.

Addresses may have multiple types. The types may be considered 'tags'. For example, many cities are tagged with the political and locality types.

The following types are supported and returned in both the address type and address component type arrays:

Address Type	Description
street_address	A precise street address.
route	A named route (such as "US 101").
intersection	A major intersection, usually of two major roads.
political	A political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.
country	The national political entity, and is typically the highest order type returned by the Geocoder.
administrative_area_level_1	A first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 short names will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data.
administrative_area_level_2	A second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_3	A third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_4	A fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_5	A fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_6	A sixth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
administrative_area_level_7	A seventh-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.
colloquial_area	A commonly-used alternative name for the entity.
locality	An incorporated city or town political entity.
sublocality	A first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types: sublocality_level_1 to sublocality_level_5. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.
neighborhood	A named neighborhood.
premise	A named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name.
subpremise	An addressable entity below the premise level, such as an apartment, unit, or suite.
plus_code	An encoded location reference, derived from latitude and longitude. Plus codes can be used as a replacement for street addresses in places where they do not exist (where buildings are not numbered or streets are not named). See https://plus.codes for details.
postal_code	A postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.
natural_feature	A prominent natural feature.
airport	An airport.
park	A named park.
point_of_interest	A named point of interest. Typically, these "POI"s are prominent local entities that don't easily fit in another category, such as "Empire State Building" or "Eiffel Tower".
An empty list of types indicates there are no known types for the particular address component (for example, Lieu-dit in France).

In addition to the above, address components may include the types listed below.

Note: This list is not exhaustive, and is subject to change.
Address Component Type	Description
floor	The floor of a building address.
establishment	Typically a place that has not yet been categorized.
landmark	A nearby place that is used as a reference, to aid navigation.
point_of_interest	A named point of interest.
parking	A parking lot or parking structure.
post_box	A specific postal box.
postal_town	A grouping of geographic areas, such as locality and sublocality, used for mailing addresses in some countries.
