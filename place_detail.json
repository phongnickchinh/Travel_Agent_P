        "text": "Visited December 16, 2025\n\nFive stars without hesitation. We are heading out tomorrow on a 17 day cruise to Hawaii and flew into San Francisco a day early to settle in and enjoy the city. My original plan for lunch was Chinese food, but I opened my big mouth and told my kids a story from 2020. When we were in LA on our way to Hawaii back then, we stopped at In N Out. My husband and I thought our older daughter, who was not even two at the time, would share the burger with us. Instead she ate the entire thing herself and my husband had to go get another one. 😆\n\nThat story completely sealed our fate. My older daughter refused anything but In N Out, so from the Marriott Marquis where we are staying, we hopped on the cable car and rode all the way there. The place was absolutely packed, but the energy was great and the line moved efficiently. Despite how busy it was, the staff remained friendly, calm, and welcoming, and we were lucky enough to manage getting a table.\n\nA special shout out to Dino who was bussing tables. He was incredibly attentive and kind. He noticed our two little girls right away and surprised them with kids activity books, which completely made their day. He checked on us several times, brought extra napkins, and made sure we were comfortable the entire time. That level of genuine care really stood out.\n\nFor the girls, we ordered two Double Doubles with just cheese, cheese fries, and chocolate milkshakes. For my husband and me, we ordered two Double Doubles with added chilies and grilled onions along with Animal Fries. We made our lemon up ourselves and it was so fresh and so good. Every single bite was delicious and absolutely worth the trip. The food was hot, fresh, and exactly as remembered, maybe even better.\n\nAfter eating, we took the cable car straight back to the hotel and everyone promptly passed out. Waking up at 1 am was no fun, but this experience was completely worth it and gave us such a fun family memory right before our cruise.\n\nThe only small hiccup was entirely on us. We forgot hand sanitizer and the restaurant did not have any available. My six year old had basically touched everything on the cable car 😆 so my husband walked across the street to buy some and paid six dollars for a tiny bottle that would normally cost a dollar elsewhere. Oh well 😆😆\n\nOverall, the food, the service, and the kindness of the staff made this an easy five star experience. Thank you to Dino and the entire team for such a memorable and welcoming visit. We loved every single moment and every bite.",

Although their menu was not very comprehensive, the food served were great-tasting and exceeded my expectations. The service crew were also very pleasant. One thing to note, though, is that it can be very packed at certain hours of the day and may be difficult to find seats. Overall, I highly recommend this place to those craving burgers and fries, and milkshake on the side.",
